We can easily create an application for the task of OTP 
verification using Python by following the steps mentioned 
below: 
1.First, create a 6-digit random number. 
2.Then store the number in a variable 
3.Then we need to write a program to send emails.
4. When sending email, we need to use OTP as a message.
5. Finally, we need to request two user inputs; first for the userâ€™s 
email and then for the OTP that the user has received. 
So this is the complete process of creating an OTP verification 
application using Python.
